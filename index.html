		<p> 	Kaise hai aap Mishra Ji? 
			First of all, a very Happy Birthday to you!! 
			I Love You So Much!!! 
			So, your dear friend had a wonderful plan 
			for your birthday,
			and here is my contribution to it.
			Just a little something that I can do during these times. 
			Now, what to say about our friendship? Its different. 
			Its hard to understand. We really haven’t spent much time 
			in person, the last time we met was back in 2016 
			when I came to India to visit and then in 2018 you were in 
			DehraDoon. We have two pictures together and they are also ugly, 
			thanks to me. I barely knew you before I left India. 
			But despite these challenges or rather I should say circumstances,
			we have grown to be really close friends. 
			You know stuff about me that no one else knows. 
			You comforted me during my low times and 
			cheered me during the good ones. 
			I feel blessed that I have a friend who I can trust and confide in. 
			I believe our mindset, outlook to life, and approach to life is similar. 
			We understand each other.We know how to keep our friendship 
			healthy and flourishing over long distances and minimal contacts.
			We chat a few times, we send memes a few times and we barely call 
			each other but every time I talk to you,it feels that we have spent
			all this time talking to each other.I just want to say that I am always
			there for you. I have seen you grown as person. 
			I have been with you when it was tough but now you are on a very good 
			track.<Never lose the motivation or the focus, you will achieve what you 
			have aimed for.I have complete faith in you. Your lows, your highs,
			anything I will stand by you, trust you, and help you in everyway possible.
			You have a friend for life in me. Distances won’t matter to us, 
			we were and always be close to each other, that is my promise to you. 
			A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!! YOU ARE THE BEST AND DESERVE THE BEST AND 
			I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST IN YOUR LIFE.<br>
			I LOVE YOU!!!

		Ur turning 22 yrs now but still, u r ____ u know what I mean, 
		but being roommate I m always with u ( depends on future ),
		But from not sharing anything to sharing everything [ nd making u understand the meaning of sharing ,
		*exception* ishy's cloths jo hum dono khabhi nhi pehan sakte😐] 
		from not trusting each other to telling one of the deepest secrets, 
		standing with each other without knowing who is right or wrong, 
		last 3yrs had taught us many things ...
		thanks for being my non- veg. partner (ur personal chef) or else yaha toh main ishy jase jaini ban jati . 
		Nd offcource we r not friends we r #208❤️--' The family away from family" 😘-hope this line never changes for us.. 
		Lastly, u should be always thankful to both of us for tolerating u and ur tantrums🤐
		Once again many many happy returns of the day.... SUKRITI, 
		I KNOW U LOVE ME OPPPPSSS SRY U LOVE MY CHEEKS MORE THAN ME😶
		So here sending this msg with ur most loved pic.( which u have only edited😊)

		<p>A very Happy Birthday to you Sukhii!You're 22 right?Itni jaldi kyu badi hogyi?
		You're one of that person in my life jo ek life me har insan ko chaiye hota hai!
		The beautiful journey started from 5th standard? Its been 12 years!! DAMN  and 
		I clearly remember teachers ki chamchi thi tu (LOL XD) that was my first impression of you.
		but later on i came to know that i was right.Hell lot of memories we have together which will
		be cherished all my life.I am so lucky to have a (best*infinite) friend like you in my life and i couldnt
		imagine my school without you, from strangers to completing my all notebooks, from being a 
		normal classmate to bench partners and from not sharing nothing to sharing everything, from irritating
		you to writing sorry letters for you etc etc! I have seen you growing as a person from a very tough time
		to a time that you always wished for! we dont talk everyday and also we meet very rarely but whenever we meet 
		or we call each other kabhi lagta hi nahi ki we are talking after such a long time & thats the beauty of our
		friendhsip!! As you know sukhii writing about you and our friendship
		will never end, i guess you know it all right? Sooo wishing you lots of health and happiness on your 22nd birthday!
		stay like this forever i am always with you.HAPPY BDAY ONCE AGAIN SUKHI❤️
